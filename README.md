Froggy Forest is a rogue-like pixel art RPG! 
All art and audio is custom made.
To run our program, all you have to do is press run!
Commented in the code is the design patterns used, descriptions of the classes and functions, and notes on if 
certain elements such as when the boss battle happens would like to be changed!
